This tutorial introduces **MongoEngine** by means of example --- we will walk
through how to create a simple **Tumblelog** application. A Tumblelog is a type
of blog where posts are not constrained to being conventional text-based posts.
As well as text-based entries, users may post images, links, videos, etc. For
simplicity's sake, we'll stick to text, image and link entries in our
application. As the purpose of this tutorial is to introduce MongoEngine, we'll
focus on the data-modelling side of the application, leaving out a user
interface.
